🖼️ Image Classification using CNNs
🔍 ImageClassifierCNN is a Deep Learning model for classifying images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It processes a dataset of labeled images and trains a neural network to recognize and categorize them based on visual features.

📌 Features
✅ Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) – Used for feature extraction and classification.
✅ Image Preprocessing – Normalization, resizing, and data augmentation for better generalization.
✅ Training & Evaluation – The model is trained and tested on real datasets.
✅ Optimization Techniques – Dropout, Batch Normalization, and Adam Optimizer for improved performance.
✅ Result Visualization – Loss & accuracy plots, confusion matrix, and test predictions.

🛠️ Technologies Used
1. Python – Core programming language
2. TensorFlow/Keras – Deep Learning framework
3. OpenCV & Matplotlib – Image processing and visualization
4. NumPy & Pandas – Data handling
